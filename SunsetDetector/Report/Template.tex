Scene detection is a complicated problem with many commercial applications in 
consumer products. For this paper, we implemented detection of sunset versus 
non-sunset scenes using  support vector machine

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
For the sunset detector project, we set out to devise an accurate way to classify
whether a given image is a sunset or not using supervised machine learning techniques.

Scene classification has several practical applications. One such use is in consumer
imaging devices to determine the best post-processing steps to deliver a high quality
image. Another would be automated image sorting based on the scene type (e.g., being 
able to classify portraits, nature shots, and so on, to categorize them in an album). 

Scene classification is difficult, even in the binary case that we consider in this
paper. Certain scenes would be very difficult to classify, as they would share the
same characteristics, such as hue and brightness features, as other scenes.
